positive z hit plot
attempt clustering with measure \Delta theta  z. loop over hits, calculate distance to other hits, make cluster.
visible cluster of hits. timing separation? is it one cluster??
missing hit in one of the detectors?


Timing calibration. We define cluster in sim data, look at delta t of hits. 
then take real data, same cluster, delta t.
same delta t?
same delta t distibution (over z)
